        <p>
          Women's issues encompass a range of challenges and concerns that
          specifically affect women. These can include gender-based
          discrimination, unequal access to education and employment,
          reproductive rights, maternal health, gender-based violence, and
          disparities in healthcare. Addressing these issues involves advocating
          for gender equality and creating a supportive environment for women to
          thrive in various aspects of life.
